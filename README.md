<h1 align="center"><b>⚡ Ethereum Token Transfer Visualization Tool</b></h1>

A lightweight and user-friendly Python + Tkinter application for visualizing and simulating ERC-20 token transfers in a test or demo environment.
This project is intended for educational and interface-testing purposes only — it does not interact with real blockchain assets or perform actual transactions.


💡 Perfect for developers, educators, and testers who need to demonstrate how Ethereum token transfers appear and behave in a controlled environment.


🚀 Key Features

🔎 Address Display — Show or generate wallet-like addresses for testing (no real private keys required or supported).

⚙️ Token Transfer Simulation — Visually represent demo transfers between addresses, mimicking ERC-20 transaction flow for UI or presentation purposes.

🧪 Test Network Friendly — Works best with test networks or mock RPC endpoints (e.g., local Ganache or Hardhat nodes).

🖥 Portable Executable — Optional Windows build available; no Python installation required.

🖼 Simple Tkinter GUI — Clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly graphical interface.

⚠️ Important Notes

This application does not handle real tokens or private keys.

Never input or connect real wallet credentials.

All displayed data is for demonstration only and holds no real value.

Recommended for use with test networks, mock APIs, or offline demo modes.
